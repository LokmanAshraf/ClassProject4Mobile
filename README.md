PROPOSAL FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT


1.1 INTRODUCTION

Mahallah booking management is an application created to improve the efficiency in the booking and managing mahallah booking system. The target user for this application is IIUM students and mahallah offices’ staffs. For students scope, the system allow the student to check and book the available room to rent. Meanwhile, for mahallah offices’ staff they will be able to reject or accept the application. Compare to the current mahallah pre-registration system, the system will be user friendly and will be more easier to be navigate. 



1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

1.2.1 Background of the problem

In developing the system, a few environment and systems that need to be set up. Some are the npm which is a package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js and Expo application by Expo Project to simulate the developed application. For the source code editor, the usage of Sublime Text was preferred as it light and free to use.
	For the target market, as it been mention in the introduction part, there are two main target which is the user and the mahallah office (MO) staffs. There are existing systems that handle these processes which a good system. But the development of this is system is to allow students to easily access and do the process easily as the matter of fact, each of people nowadays tend to have a smartphone that they carried all most all the time. On the other hand, people didn’t always bring their notebook or laptop with them unless for certain reasons. With the proposed system, target user either students or MO staffs could easily access the system and proceed with their job.    





1.2.2 Problem Statement

•	Digital attachment for payment support document as proof of payment.
•	Eliminate the usage paper form in room equipment survey. 



1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

Explain what do you want to achieve at the end of this project. For the report, what are the reports that you will produce? For the application, what are the processes that will be automated from the list of the problems that you have identified in the problem statement (1.2.2)?
What will achive that the higher percentage of student register online instead of walk in the office which irritates the staffs. Instead of that the report of equipment that are broken and unusable equipment could be produce.



1.4 PROJECT SCOPE


1.4.1 Scope

The scope of the application is only for IIUM community 

1.4.2 Targeted User

1.4.3 Specific Platform

For the time being, the needed of a server is compulsory in order to store the data and configurations of the system.
Instead of stats DB management studio also required to make the database configuration easier and able to carried out efficiently.



1.5 CONSTRAINTS

Explain what do you foresee as the major constraints for your project development e.g. budget, time, users’ commitment, etc.
The time will of course be a contributor in the list of constraint. But, the main major constraint that I think will affect the development process is debugging process which will make the project might not able to run as smooth as expected. 



1.6 PROJECT STAGES

The Stages consist of 5 stages:
Development stages which takes most of the times around 14 days,
Prototyping part for about two or three days, debugging testing and deployment.
 




1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT

The project will make up the problem that user don’t always around their notebook to access the system. Student will be able to access and book the system outside the campus anytime they required to do so.  






1.8 SUMMARY

For the conclusion, the system is meant for booking and room management for IIUM community will a little bit help student from their time restraint and provide efficiency for admin to navigate the status of the application.
